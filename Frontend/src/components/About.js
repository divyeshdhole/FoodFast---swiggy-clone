            <p>
                Swiggy Clone is a fictional restaurant review website created as a coding exercise. It uses React and Redux for state management, and it uses the Foursquare API to fetch restaurant data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app features a search bar, a list of shimmers, and a list of restaurant cards. The search bar allows users to search for restaurants by name or cuisine. The shimmers are used to create a visual effect when loading restaurant data. The restaurant cards display the restaurant name, logo, rating, and estimated delivery time.
